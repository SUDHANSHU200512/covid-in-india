              The pandemic has impacted religion in various ways, including the
              cancellation of the worship services of various faiths, the
              closure of Sunday Schools, as well as the cancellation of
              pilgrimages surrounding observances and festivals.Many churches,
              synagogues, mosques, and temples have offered worship through
              livestream amidst the pandemic.Relief wings of religious
              organisations have dispatched medical supplies and other aid to
              affected areas. Adherents of many religions have gathered together
              to pray for an end to the pandemic, for those affected by it, as
              well as for the God they believe in to give physicians and
              scientists the wisdom to combat the disease;in the United States,
              Trump designated 15 March 2020 as a National Day of Prayer for
              "God’s healing hand to be placed on the people of our Nation".

              On 18 March 2020, the World Health Organization issued a report
              related to mental health and psychosocial issues by addressing
              instructions and some social considerations during the COVID-19
              outbreak.
            </p>
            <p>
              Due to doubts if pets or other livestock may pass on coronavirus
              to humans, many people were reluctant to keep their pets fearing
              transmission, for instance in the Arab World, celebrities were
              urging people to keep and protect their pets.Meanwhile, people in
              the U.K. tended to acquire more pets during the coronavirus
              lockdown.

              The coronavirus pandemic has been followed by a concern for a
              potential spike in suicides, exacerbated by social isolation due
              to quarantine and social-distancing guidelines, fear, and
              unemployment and financial factors.

              Chaos and the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may have
              made a catastrophic future seem less remote and action to prevent
              it more necessary. However, it may also have the opposite effect
              by having minds focus on the more immediate threat of the pandemic
              rather than the climate crisis or the prevention of other
              disasters.

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              The impact on personal gatherings has been strong as medical
              experts have advised, and local authorities often mandated
              stay-at-home orders to prevents gatherings of any size, not just
              the larger events that were initially restricted. Such gatherings
              may be replaced by teleconferencing, or in some cases with
              unconventional attempts to maintain social distancing with
              activities such as a balcony sing-along for a concert, or a
              "birthday parade" for a birthday party. Replacements for
              gatherings have been seen as significant to mental health during
              the crisis.

            </div>
            <p>
              Many countries have reported an increase in domestic violence and
              intimate partner violence attributed to lockdowns amid the
              COVID-19 pandemic. Financial insecurity, stress, and uncertainty
              have lead to increased aggression at home, with abusers able to
              control large amounts of their victims' daily life. United Nations
              Secretary-General António Guterres has called for a domestic
              violence "ceasefire".

            <h1 class="text-primary font-weight-bold">Elderly care</h1>
            <hr />
            <p>
              Older people are particularly affected by COVID-19. They need
              special attention during the COVID-19 crisis, and their voices,
              opinions and concerns are important in formulating responses.
            </p>
            <p>
              Global data are extremely uncertain at present, nonetheless, the
              heightened risks of COVID-19 for older persons are evident in all
              national data. The scale of testing and nature of reporting vary
              between governments and hence there is risk of misinformation by
              generalizing from the experience and reports of a given country.
            </p>
            <p>
              While the number of older persons is relatively and absolutely
              smaller in developing countries, particularly in Africa, this
              coincides with other serious structural risks. Countries with the
              fewest older persons (such as many of the least developed
              countries), have the fewest health resources, limited experience
              caring for older patients (including few geriatric specialists),
              less institutional care for older persons, and far fewer public or
              NGO support structures for outreach, screening and community-based
              care of older persons.
            </p>
            <p>
              Older persons living in long-term care facilities, such as nursing
              homes and rehabilitation centers, are particularly vulnerable to
              infection and adverse outcomes from COVID-19. Older persons who
              live alone may face barriers to obtaining accurate information,
              food, medication, and other essential supplies during quarantine
              conditions and community outreach is required. Older persons,
              especially in isolation, those with cognitive decline, and those
              who are highly care-dependent, need a continuum of practical and
              emotional support through informal networks (families), health
              workers, caregivers, and volunteers.
